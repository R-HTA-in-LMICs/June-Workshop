# June-Workshop
This repository stores the code, presentations, and material used in the R-HTA in LMICs June Workshop. The following sections provide a breakdown of the primary documents and guidance on how to use them for your own personal training.

## 'An Introduction to R'
The general topic covered by the June workshop was '*Introduction to R: basic syntax and object manipulation*'. Several documents were provided prior to as well as during the workshop to help participants get to grips with the basics of R such as learning how to effectively manipulating R objects for decision analysis in health economics.

### [The I2R script](R/Intro2R.R):
This script provides code to freely run and explore on your own. It aims to help you come to grips with the basics of R input and output and to learn how to effectively manipulate [objects](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html) in the R language. Go ahead and use it at your leisure! Tinkering is the best way to learn, especially when learning something like the R language which, initially, may seem daunting!

### [The I2R pdf](docs/Intro2R.pdf):
This document is a pdf and provides additional information to the R script above. 

### [Presentation Slides](docs/RHTA_Workshop.pdf):
A set of slides used to present the script to learners during the June tutorial.

### [Tutorial Exercise Answer](docs/final_exercise_results_presentation.pdf): 
This script provides the correct code and answer to the hands-on programming period of the tutorial. Participants were asked to add an additional health state 's3' to the Markov model by editing and modifying the code presented at the start of the workshop.
